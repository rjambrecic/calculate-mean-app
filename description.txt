Create a FastStream application for consuming messages from the new_crypto_price topic. 
This topic needs to use a partition key.

new_crypto_price messages use JSON with two attributes 
(create class CryptoPrice with these attributes):
- price: non-negative float (it represents the current price of the crypto)
- crypto_currency: string (it represents the cryptocurrency e.g. BTC, ETH...)

The application should save each message to a dictionary (global variable) 
- partition key should be used as a dictionary key 
  and value should be a List of prices.
  
Keep only the last 100 messages in the dictionary.

If there are fewer than 3 messages for a given partition key,
do not publish any messages.

Otherwise, Calculate the price mean of the last 3 messages
for the given partition key.

Publish the price mean to the price_mean topic and use 
the same partition key that the new_crypto_price topic is using.
